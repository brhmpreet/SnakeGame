## Introduction

The Snake Game is a timeless classic that challenges players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food pellets. The objective is to avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body. This project takes the Snake Game to the next level by implementing it with Java Swing for a graphical interface and JDBC for persisting high scores in a database.

## Features

- Classic Snake Game mechanics.
- Graphical user interface using Java Swing.
- Smooth and responsive controls for an enjoyable gaming experience.
- High score tracking and storage in a Derby database using JDBC.
- Clean and organized codebase, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

## High Scores

This Snake Game allows you to save and display high scores using a Derby database. The game tracks your score as you play. If you achieve a new high score, your name and score will be stored in the database. You can view the top high scores in the game's main menu.

## Dependencies

- Java SDK: 1.8 or higher
- Java Swing library
- Derby database
- JDBC driver 

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before running the game.
